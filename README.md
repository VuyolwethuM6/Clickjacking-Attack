# Clickjacking Attack

## Introduction

Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack" or "User Interface (UI) spoofing," is a malicious technique used by attackers to deceive users into performing unintended actions on a website without their knowledge or consent. In this README, we will explore the concept of clickjacking, its potential impact, and ways to protect against it.

## What is Clickjacking?

Clickjacking is a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor overlays an invisible or deceptive UI element on top of a legitimate web page or application. This UI element can be an image, button, or even an entire webpage, making it appear as though users are interacting with the genuine content.

## How Clickjacking Works

The typical clickjacking attack follows these steps:

1. **Attack Setup**: The attacker creates a malicious web page or injects code into a legitimate one. This malicious code includes the content to be displayed to the user and any actions they want to perform, such as clicking on buttons or links.

2. **Overlaying Legitimate Content**: The attacker positions the malicious UI element over the target web page's content, ensuring it remains invisible to the user.

3. **User Interaction**: When the user visits the malicious or compromised page, they unknowingly interact with the hidden UI element, thinking they are interacting with the legitimate content beneath it.

4. **Unintended Actions**: The user's clicks or interactions trigger actions on the target website without their consent. These actions could include liking a post, sharing content, making purchases, or changing settings.

## Potential Impact

Clickjacking attacks can have serious consequences, including:

- Unauthorized actions taken on the user's behalf.
- Data theft, where the attacker tricks users into revealing sensitive information.
- Spreading malicious content or malware.
- Reputation damage to the targeted website or application.

## Protection Against Clickjacking

Protecting against clickjacking requires a combination of web development best practices and security measures:

1. **X-Frame-Options Header**: Implement the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header to restrict which domains can embed your website within an iframe. Set it to `"DENY"` to disallow framing, or specify allowed domains using `"SAMEORIGIN"` or specific domain names.

   Example:

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Use CSP headers to define where resources can be loaded from and which scripts can be executed. This can help prevent unauthorized framing and script execution.

Example:


3. **Frame-Busting Script**: Implement frame-busting JavaScript code on your website to prevent it from being displayed within an iframe.

Example:
```javascript
if (top !== self) {
  top.location = self.location;
}
```
**Security Awareness:** Educate users about the dangers of clicking on unfamiliar or suspicious links and emphasize the importance of verifying website URLs.

## Conclusion
Clickjacking is a deceptive attack that can manipulate users into taking unintended actions on websites or applications. By understanding how clickjacking works and implementing security measures like the X-Frame-Options header, CSP policies, frame-busting scripts, and user awareness, you can reduce the risk of falling victim to or being exploited by clickjacking attacks. Protecting against clickjacking is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of web applications.
